# Local Mini-Mail System
 C++


This program allowes the user to send an email from PC to virtual machine. The virtual machine acts as a cloud, it recieves the email delivered to her using threading (to do more than one email at once) and stores it in the database (a linked list) then sends it to the specified user it was sent to.
